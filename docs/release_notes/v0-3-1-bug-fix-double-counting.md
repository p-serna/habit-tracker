# Release Notes: v0.3.1 - Critical Bug Fix: Double Point Counting

**Release Date**: September 1, 2025  
**Epic**: Bug Fix for Epic 002  
**Version**: 0.3.1

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### Double Point Counting Issue
- **Problem**: Habits were awarding double points (20 instead of 10) when completed via click or swipe
- **Root Cause**: Both `database.completeHabit()` and `handleCompleteHabit()` were calling stats update functions separately
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate `updateStats()` call from main handler since database service already handles stats internally

### Point Deduction Bug  
- **Problem**: Uncompleting habits removed 10 points instead of the expected 20 when double counting was active
- **Solution**: Fixed by resolving the underlying double counting issue

### Interaction Conflicts
- **Problem**: Potential for simultaneous swipe and tap actions to trigger multiple completions
- **Solution**: Added swipe state tracking to prevent tap interference during gesture handling

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Code Changes
- **File**: `app/index.tsx:65` - Removed duplicate `updateStats()` call
- **File**: `components/SwipeableHabitCard.tsx` - Added swipe state tracking
- **File**: `src/services/database.ts` - Enhanced logging for completion tracking

### Debug Logging Added
- Comprehensive debug logs added to track all habit interactions
- Database completion operations now include detailed logging
- Swipe vs tap action differentiation in logs

## ✅ Verification

### Before Fix
- ✅ Habit completion: +20 points (incorrect)
- ✅ Habit uncompletion: -10 points (incorrect)
- ✅ Points could increase without user action

### After Fix  
- ✅ Habit completion: +10 points (correct)
- ✅ Habit uncompletion: -20 points (correct)
- ✅ Points only change on deliberate user actions

## 🧪 Testing Performed

1. **Single Completion Test**: Verified only 10 points awarded per habit
2. **Undo Functionality**: Confirmed proper point rollback (20 points removed)
3. **Multiple Interactions**: Tested rapid clicking/swiping to ensure no double processing
4. **State Consistency**: Verified UI and database remain synchronized

## 📋 Developer Notes

### Debug Logging
Temporary debug logs have been added with `🐛 DEBUG:` prefix to track:
- Habit completion calls and flow
- Database operations and point calculations  
- Swipe vs tap action differentiation
- State update sequences

### Database Integrity
The fix maintains all existing functionality:
- Undo system continues to work correctly
- Achievement unlocking remains functional
- All database operations preserve data integrity

## 🔮 Next Steps

1. Monitor app behavior with debug logs active
2. Remove debug logs once stability is confirmed
3. Continue with Epic 003 implementation (habit state management)

**Impact**: Critical - Affects core habit tracking functionality  
**Complexity**: Low - Single line removal plus defensive logging  
**Risk**: Minimal - No database schema or state management changes
